          <p class="text"> Working alongside <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/samyadayspage/home">Dr. Samyaday Choudhury</a> (Ahmedabad University, India) and in collaboration with
             <a href="https://www.stsci.edu/stsci-research/research-directory/annalisa-calamida">Dr. Annalisa Calamida</a> (Space Telescope Science Institute, USA), I carried out my undergraduate thesis work titled 
             '<a href="Undergraduate Thesis.pdf">Study of White Dwarfs in the Globular Cluster NGC2808</a>’. 

            <p class="text"> Undergraduate Thesis Abstract: NGC2808 is a very intriguing and unusual galactic globular cluster that purportedly
              has undergone more than one episode of star formation, hosting distinct stellar subpopulations. In this study, the white dwarf (WD) stars in NGC 2808 have been
              analyzed using near-ultraviolet and optical data (F275W, F336W, and F438W) from
              the Hubble Space Telescope. The identification and studies of various types of WDs
              - e.g. ones with a core composed of carbon and oxygen (CO-core) and ones with a
              core composition of helium (He-core) are crucial for understanding their formation
              scenario, which remains elusive and could depend on factors like – binarity, cluster
              mass, etc. In this study, the color-magnitude diagrams of NGC2808 using various
              combinations of filters and theoretical models of WD cooling sequences were used to
              identify WDs. Star counts of the main sequence turnoff stars and red giant branch
              stars were performed, and artificial star test results corrected their completeness.
              These were then compared with the WDs to constrain the number of WDs in the
              cluster. This is needed to understand the formation scenario of He-core WDs since
              such stars supposedly form through binary interactions for the Universe’s ∼ 13 billion year history.
